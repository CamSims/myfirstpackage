# Introduction

This package was designed for my UW STAT 302 course's Project 3. It contains
four methods for performing statistical inference/prediction:
\begin{itemize}
\item Linear Regression
\item T-Test
\item K-Nearest Neighbors with Cross-Validation
\item Random Forests with Cross Validation
\end{itemize}

```{r, include = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  collapse = TRUE,
  comment = "#>"
)
```

To install this package through Github, use

```{r, eval = FALSE}
devtools::install_github("CamSims/myfirstpackage")
```

To begin, we load the package.

```{r setup}
library(myfirstpackage)
```
